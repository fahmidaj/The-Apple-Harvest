#Description:

"Apple Harvest" immerses you in a thrilling Pygame adventure where you take on the role of a skilled orchardist tasked with harvesting apples using a specialized lever mechanism.

Demonstrate your agility and strategic thinking by harvesting as many green apples as possible while avoiding the detrimental impact of red apples. Adapt your approach based on the lever's speed and the unpredictable trajectories of the falling apples.
