# The-Apple-Harvest
"The Apple Harvest" is an engaging Pygame-based game where you control a lever to catch falling apples in an orchard setting. The game challenges your reflexes and decision-making as you maneuver the lever to catch ripe green apples for points while avoiding rotten red apples that deduct points.
